The application, developed using Python and the Dash web framework, provided three main functions: displaying "animal outcome" data in a dynamic table that can be filtered by "Rescue Type" (such as "Water Rescue," "Disaster Response," etc.), visualizing breed distributions by rescue type via a pie chart, and a map that displays a selected animal's rescue location.</p> <h3 id="video">Code Review (Screencast)</h3> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXf4k7mTM1Y?si=v8B4nACUsFdlejWJ" title="CS-499 Code Review / Nik Myers" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" class="aspect-video w-full rounded-lg drop-shadow-sm"></iframe> <h3 id="proposal">Project Proposal / Enhancement Plan</h3> <p>My proposal for this capstone project centered on rebuilding the original Dash application using a contemporary tech stack&mdash;specifically SvelteKit running on Bun using TypeScript throughout. The goal was to enhance performance, maintainability, and the user experience while preserving the core functionalities of the original application. Key enhancements included implementing a more responsive and interactive UI, optimizing data handling with Drizzle ORM, and ensuring secure coding practices throughout the application.</p> <p>A Dash-powered web application running from a Jupyter notebook was, in my opinion, a questionable choice. Unrealistic in comparison to something one would do professionally, it was also limited in terms of performance and scalability. I wanted to take something built for school and adapt it to a real-world environment. This meant rethinking the architecture, improving the data flow, and enhancing the overall user experience to meet modern web standards.</p> <h3 id="downloads">Downloads</h3> <div class="flex flex-row items-center justify-center gap-4"><!> <!></div>`,1);function U(f){const g={title:"Code Review & Project Proposal",hero:`${e}/images/panther.jpg`,summary:"A description and screencast walkthrough of my original CS-340 submission, the Grazioso Salvare animal rescue dashboard."},v={href:`${e}/enhancements/engineering`,label:"Next: Software Design & Engineering Enhancement →"};_("84jc0n",o=>{$(()=>{C.title="nik myers / code review & project proposal"})}),D(f,{get meta(){return g},get next(){return v},children:(o,k)=>{var i=j(),s=p(x(i),14),l=P(s);{let a=m(()=>`${e}/narratives/myers_proposal.docx`);u(l,{get href(){return d(a)},type:"download",children:(t,y)=>{h();var r=c("Enhancement Plan (DOCX)");n(t,r)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}var w=p(l,2);{let a=m(()=>`${e}/narratives/myers_proposal.pdf`);u(w,{get href(){return d(a)},type:"document",children:(t,y)=>{h();var r=c("Enhancement Plan (PDF)");n(t,r)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}S(s),n(o,i)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}export{U as component};
