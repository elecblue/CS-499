This involved modernizing the architecture with SvelteKit, strengthening the component structure, and migrating business logic into a cleaner TypeScript service layer. I introduced modular UI patterns, improved state management, and reworked how data flows from the database to the client to create a maintainable, testable, and scalable system. This section demonstrates how disciplined design decisions, supported by real-world engineering practices, elevate an application's long-term reliability and developer experience.</p> <h3 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h3> <div class="flex flex-row basis-sm items-start justify-center gap-4"></div> <h3 id="competencies">What Was Accomplished</h3> <ul class="list-disc pl-6 leading-relaxed marker:text-primary/80"><li>Ported application from Python and Dash to TypeScript and SvelteKit</li> <li>Refactored business logic into a clean service layer</li> <li>Implemented modular UI patterns and improved state management</li> <li>Restructured data flow from database to client for maintainability</li></ul> <h3 id="downloads">Downloads</h3> <div class="flex flex-row items-center justify-center gap-4"><!> <!></div>`,1);function Q(w){const x=[{original:`${e}/images/screens/whole-page.png`,thumbnail:`${e}/images/screens/whole-page.png`,originalAlt:"Rescue-Mate full-page screenshot",originalTitle:"Rescue-Mate full-page screenshot"},{original:`${e}/images/screens/table.png`,thumbnail:`${e}/images/screens/table.png`,originalAlt:"Rescue-Mate dashboard screenshot",originalTitle:"Rescue-Mate dashboard screenshot"},{original:`${e}/images/screens/location.png`,thumbnail:`${e}/images/screens/location.png`,originalAlt:"Rescue-Mate analytics screenshot",originalTitle:"Rescue-Mate analytics screenshot"}],R={title:"Enhancement: Software Design & Engineering",hero:`${e}/images/screens/whole-page.png`,summary:"Porting the artifact to a modern tech stack with maintainability and scalability in mind."},S={href:`${e}/enhancements/algorithms`,label:"Next: Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement →"};C("5r867s",h=>{D(()=>{A.title="nik myers / software design & engineering enhancement"})}),N(w,{get meta(){return R},get next(){return S},children:(h,W)=>{var p=U(),l=c(M(p),4);E(l,5,()=>x,I,(a,t)=>{var r=K(),i=b(r);j(i,{children:(P,Z)=>{var o=B();k(()=>{m(o,"src",n(t).original),m(o,"alt",n(t).originalAlt),m(o,"title",n(t).originalTitle)}),s(P,o)},$$slots:{default:!0}}),d(r),s(a,r)}),d(l);var u=c(l,8),f=b(u);{let a=$(()=>`${e}/narratives/myers_sde_narrative.docx`);_(f,{get href(){return n(a)},type:"download",children:(t,r)=>{y();var i=v("Narrative (DOCX)");s(t,i)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}var T=c(f,2);{let a=$(()=>`${e}/narratives/myers_sde_narrative.pdf`);_(T,{get href(){return n(a)},type:"document",children:(t,r)=>{y();var i=v("Narrative (PDF)");s(t,i)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}d(u),s(h,p)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}export{Q as component};
