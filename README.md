# CS-499
This is the main repository for my Computer Science Capstone project at SNHU. 

In the [app folder](/app), you can see the source code for my enhanced *Grazioso Salvare* web dashboard. This app is a re-implementation of a Python project from CS-340 using [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte)/[SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit), and [SQLite](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite). [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) is used as the runtime, [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for schema validation, and [Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm) for communicating with the SQLite database.

In the [artifacts](/artifacts) folder, you'll find a zip file of my original CS-340 submission.

Finally, if you change the branch to "docs", you'll see the GitHub Pages ePortfolio repo.
